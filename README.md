Mycteoma is a endemic tropical disease. It is cause by fungi (Eumycetoma), or true bacteria (Actinomycetoma).
The cure rate of Mycetoma in Sudan is only 43.3%, and the mean duration of treatment is around 18 months.


Retrospective data was collected from 348 Actinmoycetoma patients seen at the Mycetoma research center between 2012 and 2015. Of the 348 pateints, 77 patients were cured, and their data was sellected to predict the duration of treatment using machine learning algorithms (linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and neural networks).


Random forests was the best model to predict the duration of treatment, with a good MSE in training, validation and test set.
